# Automated-emailing-system-for-invoice-generation
This script automates sending emails to merchants with attached invoices using the SendGrid API. It reads merchant details from an Excel file, generates personalized emails with attached PDF invoices, and logs the process for monitoring. The script supports both test and production modes for safe testing before actual deployment.
